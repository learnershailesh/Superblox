          Hidden in the mountains of the Pixel valley there was a cave. In fact,
          this cave was so subtle and so high up, it was often mistaken for a
          small alcove. Vines with pale leaves wove across its square-like
          mouth. The unique thing about these specific leaves was that they
          shone iridescently at a specific minute on a particular day, exactly
          when the sun set on the cliff opposite. Even more unique than the
          leaves were the stones that they covered. Few explorers ventured down
          Pixel valley, for only the local villagers knew of its whereabouts.
          Most thought it ugly and overgrown, except for two teenagers. To
          passers-by, the cave at the top of the cliff, in Pixel valley, looked
          like any cave. At exactly 8:59 pm, on the last day of summer, the
          sunset on the cliff opposite the cave. The two teens Boxy and Buky
          caught the glimpse of a golden leaf amongst the pale backdrop.
          Suddenly the leaves began to glow, one by one. Colors flowed through
          the vines and the perfectly square crystalline rocks of the cave
          danced with summer's final rays. The majestic rocks were so artfully
          cut, shaped, and assembled that they did not match their surroundings.
          A flash of light cracked from the cave, and more crystal rocks began
          to protrude from the lower cliff face, spell-bindingly forming the
          shape of a pixelated, diamond hand. Mesmerized by its shimmering
          presence, Boxy and Buky climbed towards the mouth of the cave and
          suddenly were swept under the palm of the giant hand and thrown deep
          into the mouth. The leaves began turning pale in the final seconds of
          sunset. No one else witnessed the event. Tumbling down and down,
          distracted by unique colors and cubic rocks, they hit the sandy floor
          of a dark room, surrounded by ancient ruins. Pillars and blocks. They
          turned to look for the cave entrance, but there was none. Across the
          walls were carvings of human-like faces and spectacles. One carving
          stood out more than any other. It glistened in the dark room, the only
          source of light. Curious Buky walked over to the shining runes on the
          wall and ran her hand across them, to reveal golden etchings that
          formed pixelated faces of an ape and an alien. Each unique etching was
          wearing a gold hoodie and a golden pair of specs. These mystical
          beings' eyes were looking to the left of Buky. Buky turned to her
          left, pursuing their gaze, to show a small, rainbow-colored crystal
          cube on a pedestal. She picked it up, and the colors moved within,
          swirling, hypnotizing the two teenagers. Stunned by its magic, Buky
          dropped the cube, shattering its crystalline walls. An explosion of
          iridescent paint filled the room, so much so that the walls faded into
          a new horizon with every splash. They were no longer in Pixel valley,
          nor were they in the room of ruins. Unknowingly, they had opened the
          gate to a new dimension. Hidden in the mountains of the Pixel valley
          there was a cave. In fact, this cave was so subtle and so high up, it
          was often mistaken for a small alcove. Vines with pale leaves wove
